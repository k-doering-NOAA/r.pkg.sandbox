# r-pkg-sandbox
minimal r package for testing. 


# adding notes for code coverage calculations 
- permissions given are minimal (none for PR summary only, pull_request write access for PR comments)
- security of action seems good (repository activity indicates well maintained, uses pinned hash versions for actions it depends on, and furthermore doesn't require many permissions anyway.
- Feature set is good out-of-the box; also, the yml setup might be good for those who want to customize but still use the reusable action. Downside: everyone needs a yaml.
- do PR in a separate action from summary only
- TODO: investigate badges - how to set up? what permissions need to be given?
